# Statistical-Learning

Statistical learning refers to a set of tools for modelling and understanding complex data
Statistical algorithms help analyse input data and obtain useful insights from it
These insights are obtained in two ways â€“ Inference & Predictions

Learning Objective:
The main objective here is to get hands on with basic level of statistice which will be easier to understand machine learning concepts. With appropriate examples, concepts learnt will be easily relatable. So let's get started.

Audience:
Freshers/ beginners
Anyone who wants to get started with stats for machine learning
